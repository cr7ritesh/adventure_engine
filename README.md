## *Rewrite Your Favorite Stories*

---

> **Ever wished you could change the ending of your favorite movie?**  
> Or explore what would happen if a key character made a different choice?  
> **Puch Adventure Engine** is a stateful, AI-powered storytelling game that puts you in the director's chair.

Built as a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** for the Puch AI client, this engine lets you step into any fictional universe, become any character, and explore infinite "what if" scenarios. Lead the Starks to victory in Game of Thrones, see what happens if Walter White refuses to cook in Breaking Bad, or create entirely new adventures in worlds of your own making. Powered by Google's Gemini API, every choice you make creates a unique, branching narrative.
